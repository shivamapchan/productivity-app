Database Changes:
1. I made a new firestore DB named productivity-fire.
2. The first collection I added is "users."
3. The collection "users" has auto-indexed documents. 
4. Those documents have the fields "email" and "password"
5. The first page I added DB functionality to us "SignUpForm.js" because when the
user registers, their information needs to be stored in the database.
6. After starting with "users" I added another collection named "tasks." 
7. The collection "tasks" has auto-indexed documents.
8. Those documents contain the fields "task" and "useremail."
9. The fields have the task value and useremail to associate those task vals with specific users.
